    <h2>Stay in Range. Stay Profitable.</h2>
    <p>
      PoolKeeper is a tool — and a companion — helping you explore and manage liquidity pools (LPs).
      By translating complex DeFi behavior into intelligible metrics, we empower both professionals
      and retail liquidity providers to manage LP exposure like pros. We turn fragmented on-chain
      data into clear, actionable insights, so you know which pools perform, which to avoid, and
      when your position drifts out of range.
    </p>

  <section id="why-we-built-it">
    <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
    <p>
      DeFi rewards the informed, but most dashboards drown users in noise. We wanted a tool that
      tracks the health of liquidity pools like a pro would:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk-aware:</strong> measures volatility, range exposure, and TVL shifts.</li>
      <li><strong>Profit-focused:</strong> compares APR stability and turnover.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> built on open data and reproducible analytics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And perhaps most important, PoolKeeper adapts to your own risk preference. It doesn’t try to
      lecture you; it acts as an advisor, aligning and optimizing based on your individual profile.
    </p>

  <section id="how-it-works">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      PoolKeeper aggregates and scores massive data feeds from pools using a quantitative model.
      We provide score indexes for different metrics to help assess performance and risk in each
      pool’s proper context. Every metric is traceable back to on-chain data and updated regularly
      for clarity and trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      PoolKeeper is also a convenience tool making pool management a walk in the park. It can
      automatically rebalance token distributions, harvest and compound rewards, or exit
      positions—all based on your preferences.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      We are on a mission to expand decentralized finance by helping liquidity providers (that
      means you, btw) make smarter, data-driven decisions across concentrated-liquidity protocols
      and individual pools. And we’ll gladly do our part in making the big banks redundant and useless.
